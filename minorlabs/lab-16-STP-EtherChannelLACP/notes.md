"channel group 1" creates the LACP aggreation group name 1, and the purpose of LACP is to make many physical interfaces act like one logical interface. 
The two links serves like a backup/redundency incase one of the interfaces goes down.
LACP is needed in order to prevent STP from shutting down one of the links.
