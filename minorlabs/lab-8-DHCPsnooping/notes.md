In order to have DHCP Snooping in the first time, there needs to be a DHCP Server
The command starts with "ip dhcp snooping" and then additional words like "trust"
The switch table that is built is called a "DHCP Binding Table" Basically, it ensures that that specific interface or device is the only place to get IP addresses, nowhere else.
